program outline

initialize supply vector 90% that at least one part of each type if yes then quantity = 2 to 4 (uniform dist)

loop:///represents the number of time steps input by user
    1. generate new vicsc for new_vee list
    2. YardMaster scores the new_vee lists
    3. new_vee are sorted:
        a. scrapyard(list). (add total of parts if added then add broken parts if 50% or less go to scrapyard)
        b. repair queue.
    4. Check all bays
        a. if bay is available then we check the priority queue of previously repaired
        b. if PQ is empty then we loaad a vee from repair queue
        c. if the bay is occupied then look at the next broken part and check:
              i. scrapyard for it
             ii. else check supply
    5. check each testing field if vee then check all parts with a 97% pass rate
        a. if pass delete
        b. if fail pass on to PQ with lowest broken part sum is highest priority.

make a diary of sorts
